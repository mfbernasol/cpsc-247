      <h3>Piano</h3>
      <p>I've been playing piano since I was a kid. I started with Classical songs but I love playing all kinds of genres. Classical, pop, rock, jazz. I try to improve everyday.
        Learning the piano allowed me to explore more musical interests. </p>
        <p> My accomplishments are being
        in piano competitions. Here are some of my results:</p>

      <h3>DJ</h3>
      <p>Another way I make music is DJing. It's fun mixing songs and creating musical transitions. Ocasionally, I can DJ a party. </p>

      <h3>Producing</h3>
      <p>I also like making simple beats and electronic music for fun. Accomplishment would be I produced a few fully finished tracks and beats.  </p>
